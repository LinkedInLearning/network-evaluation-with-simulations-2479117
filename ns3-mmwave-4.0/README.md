# mmWave ns-3 module #

This is an [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") module for the simulation
of 5G cellular networks operating at mmWaves. A description of this module can be found in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8344116/ "mmwave paper").

Main features:

* Support of a wide range of channel models, including the model based on 3GPP TR 38.901 for frequencies between 0.5 and 100 GHz. Ray tracing and measured traces can also be used.

* Custom PHY and MAC classes supporting the 3GPP NR frame structure and numerologies.

* Custom schedulers for supporting dynamic TDD formats

* Carrier Aggregation at the MAC layer

* Enhancements to the RLC layer with re-segmentation of packets for retransmissions

* Dual Connectivity with LTE base stations, with fast secondary cell handover and channel tracking

* Simulation of core network elements (with also the MME as a real node)

## Installation
This repository contains a complete ns-3 installation with the addition of the mmwave module. 

Use these commands to download and build `ns3-mmwave`:
